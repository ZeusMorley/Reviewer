# Chapter 2: Privacy
## 2.1 Privacy Risks and Principles
### 2.1.1 What is Privacy?
#### There are three key aspects of privacy:
- Freedom from intrusion &mdash; being left alone 
- Control of information about oneself
- Freedom from surveilance (from being followed, tracked, watched, and eavesdropped upon)

#### Privacy threats come in several categories:
- Intentional, institutional uses of personal information
- Unauthorized use of release by "insiders"
- Theft of information
- Inadvertent leakage of information through negligence or carelessness
- Our own actions

We cannot expect complete privacy. Many friends and acquaintances know what you look like, where you work, what car you drive, and other similar information about you. They do not need your permission to observe or talk about you. 

Control of information about yourself means control of what is in other people's minds, phones, and more. It is limited by basic human rights, freedom of speech.

At the same time we cannot expect to be totally free from surveillance. People see or hear us when we move in public (both physically and in the Internet)

If you live in a small town, you have little privacy, everybody knows everything about you. If you are in a big city, you are nearly anonymous.

If people know nothing about you, they might be taking a risk if they let you rent a place, hire you, lend you money, and so on. So we give up some privacy for the benefits of dealing with strangers.

We choose to give up more in exchange for other benefits like convenience, personalized service, and communication with friends.

### 2.1.2 New Technology, New Risks
Computers, Internet, and all other digital devices, with their advantage in speed, storage, and connectivity, make the collection, searching, analysis, storage, access, and distribution of huge amounts of information, and images is much easier, cheaper, and faster than before. 

While these are great benefits, it has the same capabilities with threatening our privacy.

Today there are thousands to millions of databases both government and private, containing personal information about us.

In the past, there was no record of most of these information. Like our purchases, and movements. How we spend our money, what content we are interested or looking into. Other goverment documents are public, but take a long time to access. It was not easy to link our purchases, movements, or records with each other.

All these gadgets, services, and activities have benefits, of course, but they expose us to new risks. The implications for privacy are profound.

**A summary of risks**
- Anything we do in cyberspace is recorded, at least briefly, and linked to our computer or phone, and possibly our name
- With the huge amount of storage space available, companies, organizations, and governments save huge amounts of data that no one would have imagined saving in the recent past.
- People often are not aware of the collection of information about them and their activities.
- Software is extremely complex. Sometimes businesses, organizations, and website managers do not even know what the software they use collects and stores. 
- Leaks happen. The existence of the data presents a risk
- A collection of many small items of information can give a fairly detailed picture of a person’s life
- Direct association with a person’s name is not essential for compromising privacy. Re-identification has become much easier due to the quantity of personal information stored and the power of data search and analysis tools
- If information is on a public website, people other than those for whom it was intended will find it. It is available to everyone.
- Once information goes on the Internet or into a database, it seems to last forever. People (and automated software) quickly make and distribute copies. It is almost impossible to remove released information from circulation
- It is extremely likely that data collected for one purpose (such as making a phone call or responding to a search query) will find other uses (such as business planning, tracking, marketing, or criminal investigations).
- The government sometimes requests or demands sensitive personal data held by businesses and organizations.
- We often cannot directly protect information about ourselves. We depend on the businesses and organizations that manage it to protect it from thieves, accidental collection, leaks, and government prying.

### 2.1.3 Terminology and Principles for Managing Personal Data
- **personal information** &mdash; any information relating to, or traceable to, an individual person
- **handle** &mdash; user name, online nickname, identification number, email address, or phone number. Nor does it refer only to text. It extends to any information, including images, from which someone can identify a living individual.

#### Informed consent and invisible information gathering
- **informed consent** &mdash; The first principle for ethical treatment of personal information
- **invisible information gathering** &mdash;  collection of personal information without
the person’s knowledge. The important ethical issue is that if someone is not aware of the collection and use, he or she has no opportunity to consent or withhold consent. 

  **Examples:**
   - A company offered a free program that changed a Web browser’s cursor into a car toon character. Millions of people installed the program but then later discovered that the program sent to the company a report of the websites its users visited, along with a customer identification number in the software.
   - “Event data recorders” in cars record driving speed, whether or not the driver is wearing a seatbelt, and other information.
   - “History sniffers” are programs that collect information about a person’s online activity based on the different colors a browser uses to display sites recently visited
   - Software called spyware, often downloaded from a website without the user’s knowledge, surreptitiously collects information about a person’s activity and data on his or her computer and then sends the information over the Internet to the person or company that planted the spyware. Spyware can track someone’s Web surfing for an advertising company or collect passwords and credit card numbers typed by the user. (Some of these activities are illegal, of course.)

- **Cookies** &mdash; are files a website stores on a visitor’s computer.  Within the cookie, the site stores and then uses information about the visitor’s activity. For example, a retail site might store information about products we looked at and the contents of our virtual “shopping cart.” On subsequent visits, the site retrieves information from the cookie. Cookies help companies provide personalized customer service and target advertising to the interests of each visitor. They can also track our activities on many sites and combine the information. At first, cookies were controversial because the very idea that websites were storing files on the user’s computer without the user’s knowledge startled and disturbed people. Today, more people are aware of cookies and use tools to prevent or delete them. In response, some companies that track online activity developed more sophisticated “supercookies” that recreate deleted cookies and are difficult to find and remove
- **Secondary use** &mdash; the use of personal information for a purpose other than the one for which the person supplied it. Examples include sale of consumer information to marketers or other businesses, use of information in various databases to deny someone a job or to tailor a political pitch, the Internal Revenue Service searching vehicle registration records for people who own expensive cars and boats (to find people with high incomes), use of text messages by police to prosecute someone for a crime, and the use of a supermarket’s customer database to show alcohol purchases by a man who sued the store because he fell down.

  **Examples of secondary use of information**
  - **Data mining** &mdash; searching and analyzing masses of data to find patterns and develop new information or knowledge.
  - **Matching** &mdash; combining and comparing information from different databases, often using an identifier such as a person’s Social Security number or their computer’s Internet address to match records.
  - **Profiling** &mdash; analyzing data to determine characteristics of people most likely to engage in certain behavior. Businesses use these techniques to find likely new customers. Government agencies use them to detect fraud, to enforce other laws, and to find terrorists

**Forms of providing people some control over secondary uses**
- **opt-out** &mdash; Under an opt-out policy, one must check or click a box on a contract, membership form, or agreement or contact the organization to request that they not use one’s information in a particular way. If the person does not take action, the presumption is that the organization may use the information.
- **opt-in** &mdash; Under an opt-in policy, the collector of the information may not use it for secondary uses unless the person explicitly checks or clicks a box or signs a form permitting the use.

Be careful not to confuse the two. Under an opt-out policy, more people are likely to be “in,” and under an opt-in policy, more people are likely to be “out,” because the default presumption is the opposite of the policy name

- **Fair Information Principles** or **Fair Information Practices** &mdash;  various sets of principles for protection of personal data

The entity that holds the data decides how far to go in protecting the privacy of its members or customers. The individual whose data the entity might release is rarely aware of the government request. Thus, the entities that hold the data have a responsibility to those people. Planning ahead for various possible scenarios, developing a policy, and announcing it (and following it) are all part of responsible management of other people’s personal data

#### Privacy Principles for Personal Information
1) Inform people when you collect information about them, what you collect, and how you use it.
2) Collect only the data needed.
3) Offer a way for people to opt out from mailing lists, advertising, and other secondary uses. Offer a way for people to opt out from features and services that expose personal information.
4) Keep data only as long as needed
5) Maintain accuracy of data. Where appropriate and reasonable, provide a way for people to access and correct data stored about them
6) Protect security of data (from theft and from accidental leaks). Provide stronger protection for sensitive data.
7) Develop policies for responding to law enforcement requests for data.

## 2.2 The Fourth Amendment, Expectation to Privacy, and Surveillance Technologies
### 2.2.1 The Fourth Amendment
The Fourth Amendment sets limits on the government’s rights to search our homes and businesses and to seize documents and other personal effects. It requires that the government have probable cause for the search and seizure. That is, there must be good evidence to support the specific search.

#### Two key problems arise from new technologies:

1) Much of our personal information is no longer safe in our homes or the individual offices of our doctors and financial advisors. We carry a huge amount of personal information on smartphones and laptops. Much personal information is in huge databases outside of our control. Many laws allow law enforcement agencies to get information from nongovernment databases without a court order. Federal privacy rules allow law enforcement agencies to access medical records without court order
2) New technologies allow the government to search our homes without entering them, to search our persons from a distance without our knowledge, and to extract all the data on a cellphone (including deleted data and password protected data) in less than two minutes at a traffic stop.

### 2.2.2 New Technologies, Supreme Court Decisions, And Expectation of Privacy
1) **"Noninvasive but deeply revealing" searches**
  - These technologies can search our homes and vehicles but do not require police to physically enter or open them. They can search our bodies beneath our clothes from a distance without our knowledge. What restrictions should we place on their use? When should we permit government agencies to use them without a search warrant?
  - Noninvasive but deeply revealing search tools (some in use and some in development) include:
    - particle sniffers that detect many specific drugs and explosives
    - imaging systems that detect guns under clothing from a distance
    - devices that analyze the molecular composition of truck cargo without opening the truck
    - thermal-imaging devices (to find heat lamps for growing marijuana, for example)
    - devices that locate a person by locating his or her cellphone.
  
  These devices have obvious valuable security and law enforcement applications, but the technologies can be used for random searches, without search warrants or probable cause, on unsuspecting people.

2) **Supreme Court Decisions and expectation of privacy**
  - **In Olmstead v. United States,  in 1928**
    -  The government had used wiretaps on telephone lines without a court order.
    -  The Supreme Court allowed the wiretaps
    -   It interpreted the Fourth Amendment to apply only to physical intrusion and only to the search or seizure of material things, not conversations.
  -  **Katz v. United States, in 1967**
    -  The Supreme Court reversed its position and ruled that the Fourth Amendment does apply to conversations and that it applies in public places in some situations. 
    -  The court said that the Fourth Amendment “protects people, not places,” and that what a person “seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.” To intrude in places where a reasonable person has a reasonable expectation of privacy, government agents need a court order.
  - **Kyllo v. United States (2001)**
    - The Supreme Court ruled that police could not use thermal-imaging devices to search a home from the outside without a search warrant.
    - The Court stated that where “government uses a device that is not in general public use, to explore details of the home that would previously have been unknowable without physical intrusion, the surveillance is a ‘search.’”

### 2.2.3 Search and Seizure of Computers and Phones
The Fourth Amendment requires that search warrants be specific about the object of the search or seizure. Courts traditionally take the view that if an officer with a warrant sees evidence of another crime in plain view, the officer may seize it and prosecutors may use it. But the amount of information or evidence that might be in plain view in a house or office is small compared to what is on a computer

A computer at a business will have information about a large number of people. Membership lists, business records, medical records, and myriad other things can be on the same computer that law enforcement agents may search with a search warrant for specific, limited items. Access by law enforcement agents to all the data on a computer or device can be a serious threat to privacy, liberty, and freedom of speech.

- How should we interpret “plain view” for a search of computer or smartphone files? A broad interpretation—for example, “all unencrypted files”—invites abuse. 
  - Agents could get a warrant for a small crime for which they have supporting evidence, and then go on fishing expeditions for other information
    - This thwarts the Fourth Amendment’s requirement that a warrant be specific
- **Example:** While searching a man’s computer with a search warrant for evidence of drug crimes, an officer saw file names suggesting illegal content not related to the warrant. He opened files and found child pornography
  - An appeals court said the names of files might be considered to be in plain view, but the contents of the files were not.

**Phones and Laptops**
A mobile phone might contain contacts, numbers for calls made and received, email, text messages, documents, personal calendars, photos, a history of Web browsing, and a record of where the phone has been. For many people, the phone is a traveling office, containing proprietary and confidential information. A lawyer’s phone might contain information about clients and cases—legally protected from access by police.

Police may search an arrested person (without a search warrant) and examine personal property on the person (in pockets, for example) or within his or her reach. Is a search warrant required before the police can search the contents of the person’s cellphone? **Should a search warrant be required?**
  - The vast collection of information on a cellphone is the kind of information the Fourth Amendment is intended to protect.
  - A judge who ruled against a cellphone search said the justifications for permitting police to search an arrested person were to find and take weapons and to prevent the person from hiding or destroying evidence.
  - Once the police have custody of a phone, it is safe from destruction and police must wait until they have a search warrant before retrieving information from the phone.
  - The **Ohio Supreme Court** &mdash; ruled that searching an arrested person’s phone **without a search warrant** is unconstitutional: people have an expectation of privacy for the contents of their phones.
  - The **California Supreme Court** ruled otherwise &mdash; it said that search of the contents of a cellphone was **permitted** because the **phone was personal property** found on the arrested person. Police have searched cellphones taken from arrested people in dozens of cases **without warrants**.

### 2.2.4 Video Surveillance and Face Recognition
Cameras alone raise some privacy issues. When combined with face recognition systems, they raise even more. Here are some applications of cameras and face recognition and some relevant privacy and civil liberties issues.
  - In the first large-scale, public application of face recognition, police in Tampa, Florida, scanned the faces of all 100,000 fans and employees who entered the 2001 Super Bowl (causing some reporters to dub it Snooper Bowl). The system searched computer files of criminals for matches, giving results within seconds. 
    - People were not told that their faces were scanned. Tampa installed a similar system in a neighborhood of popular restaurants and nightclubs. Police in a control room zoomed in on individual faces and checked for matches in their database of suspects.
    - In two years of use, the system did not recognize anyone that the police wanted, but it did occasionally identify innocent people as wanted felons.

Clearly, some applications of cameras and face recognition systems are reasonable, beneficial uses of the technology for security and crime prevention. But there is a clear need for limits, controls, and guidelines. How should we distinguish appropriate from inappropriate uses.

If we consider these issues early enough, we can design privacy-protecting features into the technology, establish well-thought-out policies for their use, and pass appropriate privacy-protecting legislation

## 2.3 The Business and Social Sectors
### 2.3.1 Marketing and Personalization
Marketing is an essential task for most businesses and organizations. It is one of the biggest uses of personal information—by businesses, political parties, nonprofit organizations, and advocacy groups

#### Data mining and clever marketing

Customers of the British retailing firm **Tesco** permit the company to collect information on their buying habits in exchange for discounts. 
- The company identifies young adult males who buy diapers and sends them coupons for beer— assuming that, with a new baby, they have less time to go to a pub.
- **Target** beats that. Target’s data miners analyzed purchases of women who signed up for baby registries. They discovered that pregnant women tend to increase their purchases of a group of 25 products. So if a woman starts buying more of several of those products (e.g., unscented lotions and mineral supplements), Target starts sending coupons and ads for pregancy and baby products. It can even time them for stages of the pregnancy.
- To compete with WalMart, Tesco aimed to identify those customers who were most price conscious and hence most likely to be attracted to Wal-Mart’s low prices. By analyzing purchase data, the company determined which customers regularly buy the cheapest version of products that are available at more than one price level. Then they determined what products those customers buy most often, and they set prices on those products below Wal-Mart’s.

Are these examples of desirable competition or scary intrusiveness and manipulation of consumers?

Now, businesses store and analyze terabytes of data, including consumer purchases, financial information, online activity, opinions, preferences, government records, and any other useful information to determine who might be a new customer and what new products and services an old customer might buy.
  - They analyze thousands of criteria to target ads both online and offline.
  - Online retailers make recommendations to you based on your prior purchases and on those of other people with similar buying patterns. 
  - Websites greet us by name and present us with options based on prior activity at that site.

To many, the idea that merchants collect, store, and sell data on their purchasing habits is disturbing. These activities impinge upon a key aspect of privacy: **control of information about oneself.**

The companies say targeting ads via personal consumer information reduces the number of ads overall that people will see and provides ads that people are more likely to want.

Some kinds of less obvious personalization trouble people more (when they learn of them). The displays, ads, prices, and discounts you see when shopping online might be different from those others see.
