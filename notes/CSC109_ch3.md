# Chapter 3: Freedom of Speech 
## 3.1 Communication Paradigms
### 3.1.1 Regulating Communications Media
The traditional three-part framework for **First Amendment** protection and government regulation of communications media that developed in the United States in the 20th century. The three categories are:

1) **Print media (newspapers, books, magazines, pamphlets)**
    - Has the strongest First Amendment protection
    - Although books have been banned in the United States and people were arrested for publishing information on certain topics such as contraception, the trend has been toward fewer government restraints on the printed word.
2) **Broadcast (television, radio)**
    - similar to newspapers in their role of providing news and entertainment, but the government regulates both the structure of the broadcasting industry and the content of programs.
    - The government grants broadcasting licenses.
    - Licensees must meet government standards of merit—a requirement that would not be tolerated for publishers because of the obvious threat to freedom of expression
3) **Common carriers (telephone, telegraph, and the postal system)**
    - provide a medium of communication (not content) and must make their service available to everyone
    -  In some cases, as with telephone service, the government requires them to provide “universal access” (i.e., to subsidize service for people with low incomes).
    -  Based on the argument that common carriers are a monopoly, the law prohibited them from controlling the content of material that passes through their system.
    -  Telephone companies were prohibited from providing content or information services on the grounds that they might discriminate against competing content providers who must also use their telephone lines
    -  Common carriers had **no control over content**, so they had **no responsibility for illegal content passing through**.

As new technologies blurred the technical boundaries between cable, telephone, computer networks, and content providers, the law began to adapt.

The **Telecommunications Act of 1996** changed the regulatory structure.
 - It removed many artificial legal divisions of service areas and many restrictions on services that telecommunications companies may provide.
 - It also significantly clarified the question of the liability of **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** and other online service providers for content posted by third parties such as members and subscribers. 
 - Print publishers and broadcasters are legally liable for content they publish or broadcast
   - They can be sued for libel (making false and damaging statements) and copyright infringement
     - **Example**: They are legally responsible for obscene material in their publications and programs. 
 - Stated that **“no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”**
   - This statement removed uncertainty and protected service providers, thus encouraging the growth of user-created content.

### 3.1.2 Free Speech Principles
The **First Amendment** was written precisely for **offensive and/or controversial speech and ideas.**
- There is no need to protect speech and publication that no one objects to.
- It covers spoken and written words, pictures, art, and other forms of expression of ideas and opinions.
- It is a restriction on the power of government, not individuals or private businesses

Publishers do not have to publish material they consider offensive, poorly written, or unlikely to appeal to their customers for any reason. Rejection or editing by a publisher is not a violation of a writer’s First Amendment rights. 
Websites, search engine companies, and magazines may decline specific advertisements if they so choose. That does not violate the advertiser’s freedom of speech.

## 3.2 Controlling Speech
### 3.2.1 Offensive Speech: What is it? What is Illegal?
It depends on who you are. It could be political or religious speech, pornography, racial or sexual slurs, Nazi materials, libelous statements, abortion information, antiabortion information, advertising of alcoholic beverages, advertising in general, depictions of violence, discussion of suicide, or information about how to build bombs.

Most efforts to censor the Internet in the United States, including several laws passed by Congress, focus on pornographic and other sexually explicit material, so we use pornography as the first example. Many of the same principles apply to efforts to censor other kinds of material. People discuss sexual activity, of conventional and unconventional sorts, including pedophilia, in graphic detail in cyberspace.

#### What was already illegal?
In 1973, the Supreme Court, in **Miller v. California**
- Established a three-part guideline for determining whether material is **obscene** under the law
- The First Amendment does not protect obscene material
- Criteria:
    1) It depicts sexual (or excretory) acts whose depiction is specifically prohibited by state law
    2) It depicts these acts in a patently offensive manner, appealing to prurient interest as judged by a reasonable person using **community standard**
        - The application of **community standards**—was a compromise intended to avoid the problem of setting a national standard of obscenity in so large and diverse a country. Thus, small conservative or religious towns could restrict pornography to a greater extent than cosmopolitan urban areas.
    3) It has no serious literary, artistic, social, political, or scientific value

#### Figure 3.1: Freedom of Speech Guidelines
1) Distinguish speech from action. Advocating illegal acts is (usually) legal.
2) Laws must not chill expression of legal speech.
3) Do not reduce adults to reading only what is fit for children
4) Solve speech problems by least restrictive means.

Figure 3.1 summarizes principles courts use to help determine if a censorship law is constitutional. When the government is pursuing a legitimate goal that might infringe on free speech (in this case, the protection of children), it must use the least restrictive means of accomplishing the goal. The courts found that the then newly developing filtering software was less restrictive and more desirable than censorship. The judges also commented, “The government can continue to protect children from pornography on the Internet through vigorous enforcement of existing laws criminalizing obscenity and child pornography.” 

## 3.3 Posting, Selling, and Leaking Sensitive Material
#### Policies of large companies
Policy reversals by several large websites illustrate some of the dilemmas about posting legal material that is offensive to many people.
- When Yahoo expanded its online store for adult material (erotica, sex videos, and so forth—all legal), many users complained. Critics objected that because Yahoo is a large, mainstream company, its action gave acceptability to pornography. Yahoo reversed policy and removed ads for adult material. This brought complaints from other people that the company “caved in” to pressure from its mainstream advertisers and users.

#### A website with risks
Consider websites an individual or small organization might set up. To make the discussion concrete, we consider a site about suicide for terminally ill patients in constant, severe pain. The points we raise here apply to other kinds of sensitive information as well. What should the site organizers consider?First, even if the site is not advertised, search engines will find it. Depressed teenagers and depressed adults will find it. What we put on a public website is public, available to everyone worldwide. The organizers should think about potential risks and research them. Then what? One option is to decide not to set up the site at all. Suppose the site organizers decide to proceed because they believe their plan has significant value for the intended audience. What can they do to reduce risks? Perhaps require a password to access the site. How would someone obtain a password? Would a simple waiting period reduce the risk for temporarily depressed people? Would the password requirement discourage access by intended users because of privacy concerns? Do you have an ethical responsibility to avoid helping 15-year-olds commit suicide? Can you assume they would find the information to do so somewhere else and that the responsibility to decide is theirs? Do you have an ethical responsibility to help a terminally ill person in pain to commit suicide? Or will your site offer a service some people want but with risks to others that you need to minimize?

People who post risky material have an ethical responsibility to seriously consider questions such as these. The answers are sometimes not obvious or easy. Freedom of speech is not the deciding factor.

Whether thinking about setting up a website with sensitive information or thinking about passing along a funny but embarrassing video of a friend, we sum up a few guidelines:
- Consider potential risks
- Consider unintended readers or users
- Consider ways to prevent access by unintended user

#### Leaks
Leaking begins with a strong ethical case against it. Leaked documents are often obtained by hacking into someone else’s computer or by an insider who violates a confidentiality agreement. The documents belong to someone; they are being stolen or used without the owner’s permission. A leak can cause serious damage to a person or organization without their doing anything wrong.

Freedom of speech and press do not legitimate stealing files and publishing them, nor do they excuse acting irresponsibly. **This does not mean that leaking is always wrong**. It means that the **reasons for leaking the material must be strong enough to overcome the ethical arguments against it**, and the publisher of the leaked material must handle it responsibly.

To analyze the ethics of specific leaks, we consider:
1) type of material released
2) value to society
3) risks to society and innocent individuals

Documents that include **significant evidence of serious wrongdoing are reasonable candidates for leaks** . Wrongdoing might be:
- corruption
- political repression
- mass murder by armies in international (or internal) wars
- serious violations of laws or professional ethics
- safety lapses in large systems that affect the public
- dishonest practices by a business, scientists, or police; and coverups of such activities

Two controversial examples that help to illustrate the questions to consider when evaluating leaks:
1) One is the large set of U.S. military and diplomatic documents that **WikiLeaks** made public
2) **“Climategate”** is a collection of emails and other documents from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in England, one of the major centers of research on global warming.

## 3.4 Anonymity
#### Positives of Anonymity
- Protects political speech
- Provides protection against retaliation and embarrassment

On the Internet, people talk about personal topics such as health, gambling habits, problems with teenage children, religion, and so on.
Many people use pseudonyms (“handles,” aliases, or screen names) to keep their real identity private.

Victims of rape and of other kinds of violence and abuse and users of illegal drugs who are trying to quit are among those who benefit from a forum where they can talk candidly without giving away their identity.

Whistleblowers, reporting on unethical or illegal activities where they work, may choose to release information anonymously.

In wartime and in countries with oppressive governments, anonymity can be a life-or-death issue.

#### Anonymizing services
Businesses provide a variety of sophisticated tools and services that enable us to send email and surf the Web anonymously. Reporters, human rights activists, and ordinary people use anonymous email to protect themselves.

Many people use anonymous Web browsers to thwart the efforts of businesses to collect information about their Web activity and build dossiers for marketing purposes.

#### Negative uses of Anonymity
- Anonymity in cyberspace protects criminal and antisocial activities.
- People use it for fraud, harassment, and extortion, to distribute child pornography, to libel or threaten others with impunity, to steal confidential business documents or other proprietary information, and to infringe copyrights.
- Anonymous postings can spread false rumors that seriously damage a business, manipulate stock, or incite violence
- Anonymity makes it difficult to track wrongdoers. 
- Like encryption, anonymity technology poses challenges to law enforcement.
- Anonymity can mask illegal surveillance by government agencies—or legal but repressive surveillance in unfree countries
